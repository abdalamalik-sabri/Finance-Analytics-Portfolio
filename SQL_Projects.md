# üß© SQL Project ‚Äî Sales Performance Analysis

A modular SQL playbook for monitoring regional revenue, product profitability, and customer retention trends.

## üéØ Objective
Provide finance and sales leaders with reusable queries that surface high-performing regions, profitable products, and early-warning signals for churn.

## üóÇÔ∏è Schema Snapshot
```
sales_data (
    order_id SERIAL,
    order_date DATE,
    region TEXT,
    customer_id TEXT,
    product_name TEXT,
    sales_amount NUMERIC,
    cost_amount NUMERIC,
    profit_margin NUMERIC
)
```

## üìö Data Notes
- Designed for a typical sales fact table exported from CRM/ERP systems.
- Margin values assumed to be stored as decimals (e.g., 0.32 for 32%).
- Extend the schema with dimensional tables (regions, products, customers) for production deployments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Techniques Used
- Aggregations, window functions (`RANK`, `LAG`), and CTE pipelines for clarity.
- Conditional filters in `HAVING` clauses to isolate priority segments.
- Year-over-year comparisons to detect declining customers early.

## üí° Business Impact
Use the declining-customer query to trigger retention campaigns, the product profitability query to inform assortment decisions, and the monthly trend query to manage revenue pacing against targets.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. Create a staging database (PostgreSQL, Snowflake, or SQL Server) and load your `sales_data` fact table.
2. Copy the queries below into your SQL IDE and replace table names if needed.
3. Schedule the relevant queries as part of a BI refresh or reporting automation pipeline.
