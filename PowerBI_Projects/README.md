### üîÅ How to Reuse
1. Open the PBIX files in Power BI Desktop (June 2022+ recommended).
2. Refresh data connections with your own sources‚Äîfact/dimension schemas are documented in the Model view.
3. Review the `Measures` table for reusable DAX calculations (ROI, weighted pipeline, liquidity trends).
4. Export updated PDFs to share executive summaries without exposing the raw model.
