My Excel work focuses on building finance-ready models that combine rigorous calculations with executive storytelling. Download the workbooks or PDFs directly from this folder, and reference the linked documentation for methodology details.

## Projects
1. **[Orange Jordan â€” Integrated 3-Statement Model](orange-jordan-model.md)**  
   Scenario-ready forecast tying income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow to a valuation engine and KPI dashboard. Deliverables: `orange-3-statement-model.xlsx`, `orange-jordan-dashboard.pdf`.
2. **[Jordan Phosphate Mines Company (JPMC) Financial Review](jpmc-analysis.md)**  
   Ratio benchmarking and WACC estimation to assess value creation, with interactive dashboards inside `jpmc-analysis.xlsx`.

## How to Explore
- Start with the Markdown documentation above for a guided tour of objectives, methodology, and business impact.
- Use the Excel workbooksâ€™ `Dashboard` tabs for executive summaries; detailed calculations live in supporting sheets noted in each README.
- Feel free to reuse the modeling templatesâ€”driver layouts and scenario toggles are fully editable for your own projects.
